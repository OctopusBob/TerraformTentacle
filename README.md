# Terraform Tentacle
 Terraform configuration files to provision a new AWS Virtual Machine (VM) running Windows Server 2016 and install an Octopus Deploy Tentacle on it and register itself with an Octopus Server.

 Thanks to [Jeremy Cade](https://github.com/JeremyCade) for sharing his Terrraform scripts to help us with the Octopus `2018.3` release tour video.
